## Overview
This project is part of a course focused on applying principles of Software Engineering and Computer Graphics. The goal is to design, build, and render a 3D virtual scene that includes various physical phenomena such as light sources, reflections, refractions, shadows, and colors.

## Features
- **3D Scene Modeling:** Creation of a virtual 3D scene with objects and materials.
- **Physical Phenomena Simulation:** Implementation of light sources, reflections, refractions, shadows, and color effects.

## Methodologies
The project follows the methodologies taught in the course:
- **Extreme Programming (XP):** Emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to changing requirements.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Writing tests before code to ensure functionality and stability.
- **Refactoring:** Continuously improving the codebase without altering its external behavior.
- **Pair Programming:** Collaborative coding to improve code quality and share knowledge.

## Bonuses
In addition to the core features, the project includes the following advanced enhancements:
- **XML Configuration:** Used XML for configuring the scene and object properties, allowing for easy customization and scalability.
- **Super-Sampling for Soft Shadows:** Implemented super-sampling techniques to generate soft shadows, enhancing the realism of the scene.
- **Performance Improvements:** 
  - **Multi-Threading:** Utilized multi-threading to improve rendering performance by parallelizing tasks.
  - **Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH):** Applied BVH for efficient ray tracing, significantly reducing the computation time for complex scenes.
